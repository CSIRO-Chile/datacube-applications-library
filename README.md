Data Cube Applications Library (DCAL)

WARNINGS and NOTES:
  * Currently this is a work in progress.
  * Notebooks have run succesfully in the past, but aren't currently 'validated' against any particular deployment or version of ODC.
  * Ideally 'one day' these notebooks will run out of the box and be onboarded with a deploymenet of the Cube in a Box (https://github.com/opendatacube/cube-in-a-box) and/or ODC Sandbox deployment.

This repository is a placeholder/starting point for the Open Data Cube (https://github.com/opendatacube) Data Cube Applications Libary (DCAL). You can read more about here: https://www.opendatacube.org/dcal.

Development of this repository will be incremental, with the following broad steps anticipated:

1. ~~Create repository in my account.~~
2. ~~Add contents from current DCAL notebooks (as published online, circa 6 Feb 2020).~~
  * ~~Fork from FrontierSI original: https://github.com/frontiersi/odc-sandbox-notebooks/tree/master/dcal~~
  * ~~My local fork here: https://github.com/gamedaygeorge/odc-sandbox-notebooks~~
  * ~~Copy /dcal files into my new repo.~~
3. [IN PROGRESS] Work on the adaptation of the SEO's DCAL_notebooks as they are available. Create DCAL_utils as required to run these notebooks.
4. Adapt these notebooks to reference Landsat Collection 2 once it is available.
5. Consider platform on which these notebooks could be deployed.

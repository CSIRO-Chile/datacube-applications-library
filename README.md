Data Cube Applications Library (DCAL)

This repository is a placeholder/starting point for the Open Data Cube (https://github.com/opendatacube) Data Cube Applications Libary (DCAL). You can read more about here: https://www.opendatacube.org/dcal.

Development of this repository will be incremental, with the following broad steps anticipated:

~~1. Create repository in my account.~~
2. Add contents from current DCAL notebooks (as published online, circa 6 Feb 2020).
3. Work on adaptation of new DCAL notebooks (with ODC developers).
4. Confirm DCAL notebooks work on ODC Sandbox and/or standard ODC Docker deployment.
5. When ready, transfer repository to opendatacube organisation.
6. Provide stewardship and promote community ownership.
7. Collect new awesome DCAL notebooks.
8. Learn a bunch.
9. Repeat.
